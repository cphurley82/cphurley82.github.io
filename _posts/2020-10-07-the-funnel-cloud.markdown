We couldn’t believe our eyes! A funnel cloud was forming in the sky. “Aaahhh!” I yelled. “Help me!” I exclaimed. The funnel cloud threw me in the basement. Spiders were everywhere. I had to fight them. I grabbed the broom. I hit the spiders and the webs. “SHING shing” the broom swooshed. The spiders were gone except one. It jumped on me! Then I woke up. The whole thing was a dream.
